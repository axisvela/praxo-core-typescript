This repository is a discovery mirror of the canonical TypeScript source.
The monorepo remains the source of truth and the release workflow source. Shared
conformance vectors are included under `spec/`, so the implementation can be
built and tested here.

## Verify

Build and test instructions are in `language/typescript/README.md`. The
monorepo CI runs the language's conformance, API snapshot, and native tests.

PRAXO-CORE is not a hosted model, workflow engine, identity provider, or safety
controller. Do not infer exactly-once execution, complete sandbox isolation,
production security certification, live-provider behavior, or physical safety
from this package.
